NEWS - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.0.29 - 2013-01-02
-----------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN V1.0.29

	- Fixed ./configure option "--with-rcdir=no". Thanks to Jiri
	  Popelka from Red Hat (Bug #1091).

CHANGES IN V1.0.28

	- cups-browsed: Do not create CUPS queues for shared local CUPS
	  printers.

CHANGES IN V1.0.27

	- cups-browsed: The daemon crashed if there is no local CUPS queue
	  at all. Fixed.

CHANGES IN V1.0.26

	- Some fixes in README and INSTALL.
	- cups-browsed: Added daemon to browse the Bonjour broadcasts of
	  shared remote CUPS printers and automatically add local raw queues
	  pointing to them, to resemble the behavior of the former CUPS
	  broadcasting/browsing which was dropped in CUPS 1.6. Now remote
	  printers appear as local print queues as before, but with the
	  standardized Bonjour broadcasting.
	- "make dist" got broken in 1.0.25. Fixed.

CHANGES IN V1.0.25

	- urftopdf: Newly added filter to convert the URF format which (at
	  least some) iOS apps send when printing via AirPrint (Bug #1076).
	- pdftopdf: pdfautorotate functionality has been patched directly 
	  into pdftopdf (Bug #1080).
	- pdftopdf: "mirror" produced only empty pages (XObjects not there).
	- pdftopdf: Fixed segfault on "page-ranges=1-2147483647" (from cups).
	- pdftopdf: Fixed collate filler insertion.
	- texttopdf: Fixed deficient string escaping (Bug #1071).
	- pdftoopvp: Get correct byte order definition when building under
	  OpenBSD (Bug #1070).
	- serial backend: Added check for sys/ioctl.h to configure.ac (Bug
	  #1069).
	- pdftopdf: Made code building under OpenBSD (Bug #1068).
	- pdftopdf: Don't expect too much C++11 support for now (Bug #1067).

CHANGES IN V1.0.24

        - pdftopdf now generates the necessary pdf comments to disable 
          duplicate number-up when pdftops is also applied (Bug #1063).
	- pdftops: Added support for using Adobe Reader (acroread) in command
	  line mode for turning PDF to PostScript (Bug #1065).
	- pdftopdf: Fix build on OpenBSD (Bug #1062).
	- pdftops: Fix stripping of page management options from the pstops
	  command line which got already applied by pdftopdf. If the name
	  of the option to be removed is contained in the name of a option
	  in the command line (like "number-up" in "number-up-layout" or
	  "scaling" in "Natural-scaling"), this option gets stripped instead
	  of the correct option (Bug #1064).

CHANGES IN V1.0.23

	- Removed filter/pdftopdf.old
	- Fixed the requires.private for cupsfilters lib

CHANGES IN V1.0.22

	- Added missing *.h files of filter/pdftopdf/ to source file list so
	  that "make dist" builds correct upstream tarballs.

CHANGES IN V1.0.21

	- bannertopdf: Page duplication routine fixed.
	- bannertopdf: Fixed invalid output of a direct stream object.
	- pdftopdf filter replaced by new QPDF-based filter from Tobias
	  Hoffmann's Google Summer of Code project. The former Poppler-based
	  pdftopdf duplicated a lot of Poppler's code. The old filter is
	  still in the package as pdftopdf.old with source code in
	  filter/pdftopdf.old. It will be removed in a later release.
	- Added most recent contributors to AUTHORS and COPYING files.

CHANGES IN V1.0.20

	- pdftops: Added another workaround for Kyocera printers: Some
	  models get very slow on images which request interpolation,
	  so now we remove the image interpolation requests by additional
	  PostScript code only inserted for Kyocera printers (Ubuntu bug
	  #1026974).
	- pdftops: The build system only configured the default renderer
	  (Ghostscript OR Poppler), not the other renderer, but as we support
	  switching on runtime both need to get configured.
	- Improved portability of the package to non-Linux systems (Bug #1056).
	- Made the Poppler-based filters pdftopdf and pdftoopvp build with
	  both Poppler 0.18.x and 0.20.x (Bug #1055).
	- Let build system check for dlopen.

CHANGES IN V1.0.19

	- Fixes according to Coverity scan results (Bug #1054).
	- Added distribution packaging instructions to INSTALL.
	- Switched build system to autotools. This especially fixes several
	  build problems in Gentoo. Also build-tested with CUPS 1.6.0b1.
	- Fixes for compatibility with clang/gcc-4.7.
	- textonly: Filter did not work as a pipe with copies=1 (Bug #1032).
	- texttopdf: Avoid trimming the results of FcFontSort(), as this may
	  miss some reasonable candidates under certain circumstances. BTW,
	  fix passing a non-pointer as a pointer to "result" (Debian bug
	  #670055),
	- Corrected documentation. The option for the maximum image rendering
	  resolution in pdftops is "pdftops-max-image-resolution", not
	  "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default".

CHANGES IN V1.0.18

	- Modified "./configure" options related to the pdftops filter to
	  allow changing the defaults for the renderer being used by default
	  (Ghostscript or Poppler) and the maximum image rendering resolution
	  and to supply paths for both Ghostscript's gs and Poppler's pdftops.
	- pdftops: Allow selection whether Ghostscript or Poppler is used
	  at runtime, setting the "pdftops-renderer" option to "gs" or
	  "pdftops".
	- pdftops: Allow setting an upper limit for the image rendering
	  resolution, also at runtime, setting the option
	  "pdftops-max-image-resolution" to the desired limit in dpi.
	  "0" means no limit.
	- pdftops: Fixed crash by wrong usage of sizeof() function when adding
	  "Collate" to the fifth command line argument for the "pstops" CUPS
	  filter call (Ubuntu bug #982675).
	- pdftops: Removed newline from copies value when reading it from
	  the "%%PDFTOPDFNumCopies" entry of the incoming PDF file.
	- pdftops: Silenced compiler warning about ignoring the return
	  value of the write() function.
	- pdftops: Added a crash guard.
	- pdftops: Start determining the printing resolution with
	  cupsRasterInterpretPPD(), this is the most reliable as often
	  the choice names of the "Resolution" option are marketing names
	  with higher numerical values than the actual resolution. Also
	  ignore error exit values of cupsRasterInterpretPPD() as the
	  function can error out after having found the resolution.
	- pdftops: If printing resolution is determined by
          cupsRasterInterpretPPD() do not stick on 100 dpi if the
	  resolution cannot be determined (Ubuntu bug #984082).

CHANGES IN V1.0.17

	- pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation fault when printing selected pages
	  ("page-ranges" option, Ubuntu bug #980673).

CHANGES IN V1.0.16

	- pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation faults when using N-up with certain PDF
	  files (Ubuntu bug #980673) and when calling pdftopdf manually without
          specifyting a PPD file.

CHANGES IN V1.0.15

	- pdftops: Suppress image compression only for Brother printers as they
	  really need this measure to print at all. This accelerates printer-
	  internal job processing on most other printers (tested on HP and
	  Kyocera). Also suppress page compression on Kyocera printers, this
	  works around a bug in Kyocera's PostScript interpreters which makes
	  printing pages with images very slow (Ubuntu bug #977912).

CHANGES IN V1.0.14

	- pdftops: Determine printing resolution from the PPD file and supply
	  it on the Ghostscript or pdftops (Poppler) command line, so that
	  the renderer does the image rendering with a resolution matching the
	  printer's resolution. This avoids too slow processing of the jobs
	  by the printer's built-in PostScript interpreter. In addition
	  a default resolution of 300 dpi is used for PPDs without any hint
	  of the printer's resolution, as most PostScript lasers use multiples
	  of 300 dpi as resolution (Ubuntu bug #977912).

CHANGES IN V1.0.13

	- bannertopdf: Fix display of the job dates on the test page and on
	  banner pages (Ubuntu bug #975064).

CHANGES IN V1.0.12

	- Fixed crash of imagetopdf filter when it is called manually
	  without supplying a valid PPD file (Ubuntu bug #973564).

CHANGES IN V1.0.11

	- Actually install the Generic PDF printer PPD file.
	- Really introduce a Generic PDF printer PPD file.

CHANGES IN V1.0.10

	- Added Generic PPD file for native PDF printers.
	- Updated all code copied from Poppler to the current state of Poppler.
	- Made Poppler-based PDF filters building with various versions of
	  Poppler.
	  
CHANGES IN V1.0.9

	- Deactivated NIME conversion rules which are not used by the PDF-
	  based printing workflow.
	- Cleaned up sample PPD file HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
	- imagetopdf: Added support for native PDF printers.
	- imagetopdf, imagetoraster: Let image input "scale to fit"
	  by default. This makes photo printing via AirPrint work,
	  as the iOS devices send JPEG but do not allow setting options.

CHANGES IN V1.0.8

	- pdftops: Generally do not compress fonts and images, and
	  also do not do CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs to make
	  the PostScript output more compatible with buggy PostScript
	  interpreters. The output gets 30-50% longer but will work on
	  many more different printer models. Problems were also
	  discovered on HP and not only on Brother (Ubuntu bug
	  #960666).

CHANGES IN V1.0.7

	- pdftops: Added PostScript debug mode. For jobs sent with "-o psdebug"
	  the PostScript output by Ghostscript does not have compression of
	  pages and fonts, so that one can analyse the PostScript code,
	  especially in cases of incompatibilities and bugs of the built-in
	  PostScript interpreters of printers. Thanks to the Ghostscript
	  upstream developers for this hint.

CHANGES IN V1.0.6

	- texttopdf: Fixed minor miscalculation of /AvgWidth.
	- texttopdf: Added support for direct file references in pdf.utf-8.
	- pdftops: Added another workaround for a bug in Brother's PostScript
	  interpreter: Suppress CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs and
	  images on Brother printers (Ubuntu bug #955553).
	- texttopdf: Fixed typo in pdf font descriptor dictionary keys.
	- Fixed ColorDevice definition in cupsfilters.drv for HP DesignJet
	  printers.
	- Put ModelNumber entries in cupsfilters.drv at the right place to
	  get correct "*cupsModelNumber:" entries in the PPDs for the HP
	  DesignJet printers.
	- rastertopclx: Code of JCL options did not get inserted into the JCL
	  header.
	- parallel backend: Use the same way as CUPS does to prevent an
	  infinite loop on side channel errors (CUPS STR #4044).
	- pdftopdf: Added support for native PDF printers, add JCL (PJL) 
	  options and send page_log entries only if the PDF has the
	  "*JCLToPDFInterpreter:" keyword.
	- Updated README.txt for the new native PDF printer support.
	- Added a sample PPD file for a native PDF printer,
	  HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
	- texttopdf: A lot of internal rework; also split up into more files
	- texttopdf: Fixed many bugs on the way
	- texttopdf: Added support for CFF-flavoured OTFs; for these
          subsetting is not yet implemented, full embedding is done instead
	- texttopdf: Adapted and improved fontconfig font selection
	- Make sure that "make clean" and "make distclean" also work if
	  Makedefs does not exist (Debian bug #663564).

CHANGES IN V1.0.5

	- pdftops: Added insertion of workaround PostScript code for printers
	  with bugs in their PS interpreters (Ubuntu bugs #950713, #951627).
	- parallel backend: Break infinite loop (Ubuntu bug #936647).
	- texttopdf: Complete the implementation of fontconfig-based font
	  selection (Debian bug #663070).

CHANGES IN V1.0.4

	- texttopdf: Fall back to altermative fonts via fontconfig if the
	  FreeMono TrueType fonts are not installed (Debian bugs #495598
	  and #662660).
	- bannertopdf: Fix off-by-one error in page duplication
	- bannertopdf: Put indirect references to streams into the page's
	  contents
	- bannertopdf: Let byte offsets for the Xref table of the PDF output
	  being determined correctly also when the output goes to stdout
	  (Ubuntu bug #939735).
	- bannertopdf: Output multiple copies of the test page if duplex
	  and/or N-up is chosen, to let the test page appear on all possible
	  positions of the sheet (Ubuntu bug #939530).

CHANGES IN V1.0.3

	- bannertopdf: Draw the frame to mark the non-printable borders 1pt
	  smaller all around to assure that it is always visible, like it was
	  done in bannertops.
	- bannertopdf: Scale the page to fit onto the desired output page.
	- bannertopdf: Get and output the correct media limits.

CHANGES IN V1.0.2

	- bannertopdf: Fixed crash caused by wrong Poppler API use.
	- bannertopdf: Info text on test page came out in gray and not in
	  black.

CHANGES IN V1.0.1

	- Added the textonly filter and its PPD file, a driver for text-only
	  printers.
	- Install the pdftoijs sample PPD file
	  HP-PhotoSmart_Pro_B8300-hpijs-pdftoijs.ppd
	- Added cupsfilters.drv, centralized ppdc-based PPD generator for the
	  printer driver filters in this package. Current printers supported
	  are several HP DesignJet large format inkjet printers.
	- Fixed "make uninstall". Now everything of this package gets removed.
	- Added wrapper scripts texttops and imagetops for backward
	  compatibility to third-party PPD files or custom configurations
	  which refer to these filters explicitly (Debian bug #658258).

CHANGES IN V1.0

	- Built the pdftops filter based on Ghostscript by default, as
	  Ghostscript is better optimized for print output (Ubuntu bug
	  #926068).
	- If the pdftops filter is built for using Poppler, let Poppler not
	  emit PostScript level 3, as this causes problems with some HP
	  printers (Ubuntu bug #277404, Freedesktop (Poppler) bug #19640).
	- bannertopdf needs to be linked with C++ (bug #995)
	- Added test.sh script for testing texttopdf
	- Added original documentation of the PDF filters to README.txt
	- Install C header files and the static library
	- General clean-up of "make install" targets in Makefiles
	- Raised MIME conversion cost factor of pdftoraster from 66 to 100 to
	  give priority to the gstoraster filter from Ghostscript, as this
	  filter supports ICC-profile-based color management.
	- Documentation updated because libijs, liblcms, freetype, and
          fontconfig are needed to build this package

CHANGES IN V1.0b1

	- Removed the bannertops, imagetops, and texttops filters, they are
	  not needed any more in the PDF-based printing workflow
	- Added support for liblcms2
	- Named the package "OpenPrinting CUPS Filters"
	- Renamed libcupslegacy to libcupsfilters
	- Joined pdftops and cpdftocps filters into one C program
	- Added new bannertopdf filter from Lars Uebernickel:
	  https://launchpad.net/bannertopdf
	- Added the filters for the PDF-based printing workflow, from
	  OpenPrinting: http://sourceforge.jp/projects/opfc/ and
	  http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/pdf-printing/
	- Initial packaging of files that are no longer included in CUPS 1.6
	  from CUPS upstream (http://www.cups.org/)
