INSTALL - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v2.0b2 - 2023-01-08
-------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters from source code. For more information on OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters see the file called "README.md".  A complete change log can be
found in "CHANGES.md".

**** IF YOU HAVE A NON-POSTSCRIPT PRINTER AND ARE NOT       ****
**** RUNNING MAC OS X, YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO INSTALL        ****
**** GHOSTSCRIPT WITH AT LEAST THE "cups", "pwgraster",     ****
**** "appleraster", "urf", "pclm", "pclm8", "pdfwrite",     ****
**** "pdfimage24", "pdfimage32", "pdfimage8" DRIVERS AFTER  ****
**** YOU INSTALL CUPS AND BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS PACKAGE.  ****


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

    You'll need ANSI-compliant C, plus a make program and POSIX-compliant shell
    (/bin/sh).  The GNU compiler tools and Bash work well and we have tested
    the current CUPS code against several versions of GCC with excellent results.

    The Makefiles used by the project should work with most versions of make.
    We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs shipped by
    Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.  BSD users should use GNU make (gmake) since BSD
    make does not support "include".

    libcups (of CUPS 2.2.2 or newer), libcupsfilters 2.x, and libppd
    must be installed to be able to compile this package.

COMPILING THE GIT REPOSITORY CODE

    The CUPS Filters GIT repository doesn't hold a copy of the
    pre-built configure script. You'll need to run the GNU autoconf
    software (2.65 or higher) to create it:

        ./autogen.sh


CONFIGURATION

    CUPS Filters uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the usual
    "configure" script in the main CUPS Filters source directory.  To
    configure CUPS Filters for your system, type:

	./configure

    The default installation will put the CUPS Filters software in the
    "/usr" directory on your system.

    Use the "--prefix" option to install the CUPS Filters software in
    another location:

	./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    To see a complete list of configuration options, use the --help
    option:

        ./configure --help

    If any of the dependent libraries are not installed in a system
    default location (typically "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib") you'll
    need to set the CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, DSOFLAGS, and LDFLAGS
    environment variables prior to running configure:

	setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	./configure ...

    or:

	CFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	./configure ...

    Once you have configured things, just type:

	make ENTER

    or if you have FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD type:

	gmake ENTER

    to build the software.


INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

    Once you have built the software you need to install it.  The "install"
    target provides a quick way to install the software on your local system:

	make install ENTER

    or for FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD:

	gmake install ENTER

PACKAGING THE SOFTWARE FOR OPERATING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTIONS

    The use of this version of cups-filters is supported for CUPS 2.x
    from version 2.2.2 on. For earlier versions of CUPS please use
    cups-filters 1.x. For CUPS 3.x this package will not be needed any
    more.
