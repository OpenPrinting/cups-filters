INSTALL - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.17.2 - 2017-08-25
--------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters from source code. For more information on OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters see the file called "README.txt".  A complete change log can
be found in "CHANGES.txt".

**** IF YOU HAVE A NON-POSTSCRIPT PRINTER AND ARE NOT       ****
**** RUNNING MAC OS X, YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO INSTALL GPL    ****
**** GHOSTSCRIPT WITH THE "cups" DRIVER AFTER YOU INSTALL   ****
**** CUPS AND BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS PACKAGE.              ****


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

    You'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers, plus a make program and
    POSIX-compliant shell (/bin/sh).  The GNU compiler tools and Bash work well
    and we have tested the current CUPS code against several versions of GCC
    with excellent results.

    The makefiles used by the project should work with most versions of make.
    We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs shipped by
    Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.  BSD users should use GNU make (gmake) since BSD
    make does not support "include".

    Poppler, libijs, freetype, fontconfig, and liblcms (liblcms2 recommended) 
    must be installed to be able to compile this package.

    Note that Poppler has to be compiled with the
    "--enable-poppler-cpp" configure option (or the
    "libpoppler-cpp-dev(el)" package has to be installed if the
    Poppler packages from a Linux distribution are used).

    Besides these tools you'll want the JPEG, PNG, TIFF, ZLIB libraries for
    image support. CUPS Filters will compile and run without these, however
    you'll miss out on many of the features provided by CUPS Filters.

    To get cups-browsed, the daemon to browse Bonjour broadcasts of
    remote CUPS queues and make the queues available locally, you also
    need libavahi-common and libavahi-client.

COMPILING THE BZR REPOSITORY CODE

    The CUPS Filters BZR repository doesn't hold a copy of the pre-built
    configure script.  You'll need to run the GNU autoconf software (2.65 or
    higher) to create it:

        ./autogen.sh


CONFIGURATION

    CUPS Filters uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the usual "configure"
    script in the main CUPS Filters source directory.  To configure CUPS 
    Filters for your system, type:

	./configure

    The default installation will put the CUPS Filters software in the
    "/etc" and "/usr" directories on your system, which will overwrite
    some of the original filters and their auxiliary files of CUPS
    1.5.x or earlier and the auxiliary files of bannertops in all CUPS
    versions including version 1.6.x (see also the section "PACKAGING
    THE SOFTWARE FOR OPERATING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTIONS" below). The
    system will still have the same functionality as before, but CUPS
    will not convert all incoming files into PostScript any more, it
    will convert them into PDF instead and after applying page
    management (N-up, selected pages, reverse order, ...) by the
    pdftopdf filter and convert PDF into the printer's native format
    then (PDF-based printing workflow). CUPS 1.6.x or later does not
    contain any filters which this package provides. It requires the
    installation of this package for printing with filters and drivers
    under Linux (or other non-Mac-OS-X operation systems).

    Use the "--prefix" option to install the CUPS Filters software in another
    location:

	./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    To see a complete list of configuration options, use the --help option:

        ./configure --help

    If any of the dependent libraries are not installed in a system default
    location (typically "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib") you'll need to set the
    CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, DSOFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment variables
    prior to running configure:

	setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	./configure ...

    or:

	CFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	./configure ...

    Once you have configured things, just type:

	make ENTER

    or if you have FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD type:

	gmake ENTER

    to build the software.


INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

    Once you have built the software you need to install it.  The "install"
    target provides a quick way to install the software on your local system:

	make install ENTER

    or for FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD:

	gmake install ENTER

PACKAGING THE SOFTWARE FOR OPERATING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTIONS

    The use of cups-filters is supported for CUPS from version 1.5.x
    on (to switch to the PDF-based printing workflow already now) and
    required for CUPS 1.6.x (as it does not ship a complete filter set
    any more). In both cases cups-filters ships some files which exist
    also in CUPS, but the versions of cups-filters have to be used to
    assure that printing works correctly. So in the packaging of CUPS
    the files should be removed.

    Use the alternatives facility (see update-alternatives(8)) only if
    your CUPS version is 1.5.x and you want to make the use of
    cups-filters optional. Note that then the files of cups-filters
    need to have priority.

    When using cups-filters with CUPS 1.5.x, many of the original CUPS
    filters get replaced or at least useless. Please remove the
    following files from your CUPS package:

	/usr/lib/cups/backend/serial
	/usr/lib/cups/backend/parallel
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/bannertops
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/commandtoescpx
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/commandtopclx
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/imagetops
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/imagetoraster
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/pdftops
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertoescpx
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertopclx
	/usr/lib/cups/filter/texttops
	/usr/share/cups/banners/*
	/usr/share/cups/data/testprint
	/usr/share/cups/data/psglyphs
	/usr/share/cups/fonts/*

    Also comment out all conversion rules which use any of the removed
    filters. You can do it with the following command line:

	perl -p -i -e 's:^(.*\s+(pdftops|texttops|imagetops|bannertops|imagetoraster)\s*)$:#\1:' /usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs

    If you use CUPS 1.6.x there is less to remove from the CUPS
    package. It is only bannertops and its auxiliary files which are
    in the way for bannertopdf:

	/usr/lib/cups/filter/bannertops
	/usr/share/cups/banners/*
	/usr/share/cups/data/testprint

    The conversion rules get commented out via:

	perl -p -i -e 's:^(.*\s+bannertops\s*)$:#\1:' /usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs

    For CUPS 1.6.x a bug report/feature request is posted to ask for
    (at least optional) removal of bannertops:
