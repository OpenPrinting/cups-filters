.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcups-browsed\fP has two independently switchable functions:
.IP 1. 4
Browse DNS-SD broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local
CUPS queues pointing to these printers.
.IP 2. 4
Find shared printers on given CUPS servers and create local CUPS queues
pointing to them.
.PP

cups-browsed can be run permanently (from system boot to shutdown) or on-demand (for example to save resources on mobile devices). For running it on-demand an auto-shutdown feature can be activated to let cups-browsed terminate when it does not have queues any more to take care of.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP, \fB-d\fP, \fB--debug\fP
Debug mode, verbose logging to stderr
.TP
.B
\fB-l\fP, \fB--logfile\fP
Debug logging into /var/log/cups/cups-browsed_log file.
.TP
.B
\fB-c\fP \fIconfig-file\fP
Uses the alternative configuration file \fIconfig-file\fP instead of the standard one.
.TP
.B
\fB-o\fP \fIoption\fB=\fIvalue\fB, -o\fP '\fIconfig file line\fP'
Supply configuration options via the command line. You can supply any line which also could be put into the configuration file, but note that due to the spaces the line has to be put into quotes, or for a simple key/value pair the space between key and value can get replaced by '='. If command-line-supplied configuration settings are contradicting with the ones in the configuration file, the ones in the configuration file will get used.
.TP
.B
\fB--autoshutdown=mode\fP
Auto shutdown mode, \fBmode\fP is \fBoff\fP for no auto shutdown, \fBon\fP for auto shutdown being active, and \fBavahi\fP for control by the avahi-daemon being run on-demand, getting auto-shutdown turned off while avahi-daemon is present and on when avahi-daemon is shut down.
.TP
.B
\fB--autoshutdown-on=inactivity-type\fP
What cups-browsed considers as inactivity for auto-shutdown. \fBinactivity-type\fP set to \fBno-queues\fP (the default) means that auto-shutdown is initiated if there are no queues generated by cups-browsed any more, \fBno-jobs\fP means that auto-shutdown will get initiated if all queues generated by cups-browsed are without jobs.
.TP
.B
\fB--autoshutdown-timeout=timeout\fP
\fBtimeout\fP tells after how many seconds cups-browsed should shut down if it has no local queues set up for any discovered remote printer any more or jobs on these. Default is 30 seconds. 0 means immediate shutdown.
.TP
.B
\fB-h, --help, --version\fP
Display usage and version info and do not start the daemon.
.SH FILES
/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf
