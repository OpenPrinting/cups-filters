.SH NAME
\fBcups-browsed.conf \fP- server configuration file for cups-browsed
\fB
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cups-browsed.conf file configures the cups-browsed daemon. It is normally
located in the /etc/cups directory. Each line in the file can be a
configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start
with the # character.
.SH DIRECTIVES

The BrowseAllow directive specifies a system or network to accept
CUPS browse packets from. The default is to accept browse packets from
all hosts when BrowseRemoteProtocols uses the CUPS protocol.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseAllow All
        BrowseAllow 192.168.7.20
        BrowseAllow 192.168.7.0/24
        BrowseAllow 192.168.7.0/255.255.255.0


.fam T
.fi
The BrowsePoll directive polls a server for available printers once
every 60 seconds. Multiple BrowsePoll directives can be specified
to poll multiple servers. The default port to connect to is 631.
BrowsePoll works independently of whether CUPS browsing is activated
in BrowseRemoteProtocols.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowsePoll 192.168.7.20
        BrowsePoll 192.168.7.65:631
        BrowsePoll host.example.com:631


.fam T
.fi
The BrowseLocalProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use
when advertising local shared printers on the network. The default
is "none". Control of advertising of local shared printers using
dnssd is done in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseLocalProtocols none
        BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS


.fam T
.fi
The BrowseRemoteProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use
when finding remote shared printers on the network. Multiple
protocols can be specified by separating them with spaces.
The default is "dnssd cups".
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseRemoteProtocols none
        BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS dnssd
        BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS
        BrowseRemoteProtocols dnssd
        BrowseRemoteProtocols ldap

.fam T
.fi
The BrowseProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use when
finding remote shared printers on the network and advertising local
shared printers. "dnssd" and "ldap" are ignored for BrowseLocalProtocols.
Multiple protocols can be specified by separating them with spaces. The
default is "none" for BrowseLocalProtocols and "dnssd cups" for
BrowseRemoteProtocols.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseProtocols none

The configuration for the LDAP browsing mode define where the LDAP search
should be performed. If built with an LDAP library that supports TLS, the
path to the server's certificate, or to a certificates store, can be
specified.
The optional filter allows the LDAP search to be more specific, and is used
in addition to the hardcoded filter (objectclass=cupsPrinter).
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseLDAPBindDN cn=cups-browsed,dc=domain,dc=tld
        BrowseLDAPCACertFile /path/to/server/certificate.pem
        BrowseLDAPDN ou=printers,dc=domain,dc=tld
        BrowseLDAPFilter (printerLocation=/Office 1/*)
        BrowseLDAPPassword s3cret
        BrowseLDAPServer ldaps://ldap.domain.tld

.fam T
.fi
The DomainSocket directive specifies the domain socket through which
the locally running CUPS daemon is accessed. If not specified the
standard domain socket of CUPS is used. Use this if you have specified
an alternative domain socket for CUPS via a Listen directive in
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf. If cups-browsed is not able to access the local
CUPS daemon via a domain socket it accesses it via localhost.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        DomainSocket /var/run/cups/cups.sock

Set IPBasedDeviceURIs to "Yes" if cups-browsed should create its local
queues with device URIs with the IP addresses instead of the host
names of the remote servers. This mode is there for any problems with
host name resolution in the network, especially also if avahi-daemon
is only run for printer discovery and already stopped while still
printing. By default this mode is turned off, meaning that we use URIs
with host names.
.PP
If you prefer IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses in the URIs, you can set
IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv4" to only get IPv4 IP addresses or
IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv6" to only get IPv6 IP addresses.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        IPBasedDeviceURIs No
        IPBasedDeviceURIs Yes
        IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv4
        IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv6

The CreateIPPPrinterQueues directive specifies whether cups-browsed
should discover IPP printers (via Bonjour) and if they understand a
known page description language (PWG Raster, PDF, PostScript, PCL XL,
PCL 5c/e) create PPD-less print queues (using a System V interface
script to control the filter chain). Clients have to IPP-poll the
capabilities of the printer and send option settings as standard IPP
attributes. We do not poll the capabilities by ourselves to not wake
up the printer from power-saving mode when creating the queues. Jobs
have to be sent in PDF format. Other formats are not accepted. This
functionality is primarily for mobile devices running CUPS to not need
a printer setup tool nor a collection of printer drivers and PPDs.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes

If cups-browsed is automatically creating print queues for native
IPP network printers ("CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes"), the type of
queue to be created can be selected by the "IPPPrinterQueueType"
directive.  The "PPD" setting makes always queues with PPD file
being created and no queue if the printer does not supply sufficient
information for creating a PPD. With "NoPPD" the queue is always
created with a System V interface script as filter, also when
creatig a PPD would be possible.  "Auto" (the default) lets a PPD
being created if the printer supplies sufficient information and a
System V interface script otherwise.
.PP

        IPPPrinterQueueType Auto

The LoadBalancing directive switches between two methods of handling
load balancing between equally-named remote queues which are
represented by one local print queue making up a cluster of them
(implicit class).
.PP
The two methods are:
.PP
Queuing of jobs on the client (LoadBalancing QueueOnClient):
.PP
Here we queue up the jobs on the client and regularly check the
clustered remote print queues. If we find an idle queue, we pass
on a job to it.
.PP
This is also the method which CUPS uses for classes. Advantage is a
more even distribution of the job workload on the servers
(especially if the printing speed of the servers is very different),
and if a server fails, there are not several jobs stuck or
lost. Disadvantage is that if one takes the client (laptop, mobile
phone, ...) out of the local network, printing stops with the jobs
waiting in the local queue.
.PP
Queuing of jobs on the servers (LoadBalancing QueueOnServers):
.PP
Here we check the number of jobs on each of the clustered remote
printers and send an incoming job immediately to the remote printer
with the lowest amount of jobs in its queue. This way no jobs queue
up locally, all jobs which are waiting are waiting on one of the
remote servers.
.PP
Not having jobs waiting locally has the advantage that we can take
the local machine from the network and all jobs get printed.
Disadvantage is that if a server with a full queue of jobs goes
away, the jobs go away, too.
.PP
Default is queuing the jobs on the client as this is what CUPS does
with classes.

With the DefaultOptions directive one or more option settings can be
defined to be applied to every print queue newly created by
cups-browsed. Each option is supplied as one supplies options with the
"-o" command line argument to the "lpadmin" command (Run "man lpadmin"
for more details). More than one option can be supplied separating the
options by spaces. By default no option settings are pre-defined.
.PP
Note that print queues which cups-browsed already created before
remember their previous settings and so these settings do not get
applied.

The AutoShutdown directive specifies whether cups-browsed should
automatically terminate when it has no local raw queues set up
pointing to any discovered remote printers (auto shutdown
mode). Setting it to "On" activates the auto-shutdown mode, setting it
to "Off" deactiivates it (the default). The special mode "avahi" turns
auto shutdown off while avahi-daemon is running and on when
avahi-daemon stops. This allows running cups-browsed on-demand when
avahi-daemon is run on-demand.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        AutoShutdown Off
        AutoShutdown On
        AutoShutdown avahi

.fam T
.fi
The AutoShutdownTimeout directive specifies after how many seconds
without local raw queues set up pointing to any discovered remote
printers cups-browsed should actually shut down in auto shutdown
mode. Default is 30 seconds, 0 means immediate shutdown.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        AutoShutdownTimeout 20
