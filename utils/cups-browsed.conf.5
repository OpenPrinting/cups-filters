.SH NAME
\fBcups-browsed.conf \fP- server configuration file for cups-browsed
\fB
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cups-browsed.conf file configures the cups-browsed daemon. It is normally
located in the /etc/cups directory. Each line in the file can be a
configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start
with the # character.
.SH DIRECTIVES

The BrowseAllow directive specifies a system or network to accept
CUPS browse packets from. The default is to accept browse packets from
all hosts when BrowseRemoteProtocols uses the CUPS protocol.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseAllow 192.168.7.20
        BrowseAllow 192.168.7.0/24
        BrowseAllow 192.168.7.0/255.255.255.0


.fam T
.fi
The BrowsePoll directive polls a server for available printers once
every 60 seconds. Multiple BrowsePoll directives can be specified
to poll multiple servers. The default port to connect to is 631.
BrowsePoll works independently of whether CUPS browsing is activated
in BrowseRemoteProtocols.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowsePoll 192.168.7.20
        BrowsePoll 192.168.7.65:631
        BrowsePoll host.example.com:631


.fam T
.fi
The BrowseLocalProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use
when advertising local shared printers on the network. The default
is "none". Control of advertising of local shared printers using
dnssd is done in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseLocalProtocols none
        BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS


.fam T
.fi
The BrowseRemoteProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use
when finding remote shared printers on the network. Multiple
protocols can be specified by separating them with spaces.
The default is "dnssd cups".
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseRemoteProtocols none
        BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS dnssd
        BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS
        BrowseRemoteProtocols dnssd

.fam T
.fi
The BrowseProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use when
finding remote shared printers on the network and advertising local
shared printers. "dnssd" is ignored for BrowseLocalProtocols. Multiple
protocols can be specified by separating them with spaces. The
default is "none" for BrowseLocalProtocols and "dnssd cups" for
BrowseRemoteProtocols.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        BrowseProtocols none
        BrowseProtocols CUPS dnssd
        BrowseProtocols CUPS
        BrowseProtocols dnssd

.fam T
.fi
The DomainSocket directive specifies the domain socket through which
the locally running CUPS daemon is accessed. If not specified the
standard domain socket of CUPS is used. Use this if you have specified
an alternative domain socket for CUPS via a Listen directive in
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf. If cups-browsed is not able to access the local
CUPS daemon via a domain socket it accesses it via localhost.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        DomainSocket /var/run/cups/cups.sock

.fam T
.fi
The CreateIPPPrinterQueues directive specifies whether cups-browsed
should discover IPP printers (via Bonjour) and if they understand a
known page description language (PWG Raster, PDF, PostScript, PCL XL,
PCL 5c/e) create PPD-less print queues (using a System V interface
script to control the filter chain). Clients have to IPP-poll the
capabilities of the printer and send option settings as standard IPP
attributes. We do not poll the capabilities by ourselves to not wake
up the printer from power-saving mode when creating the queues. Jobs
have to be sent in PDF format. Other formats are not accepted. This
functionality is primarily for mobile devices running CUPS to not need
a printer setup tool nor a collection of printer drivers and PPDs.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes

.fam T
.fi
The AutoShutdown directive specifies whether cups-browsed should
automatically terminate when it has no local raw queues set up
pointing to any discovered remote printers (auto shutdown
mode). Setting it to "On" activates the auto-shutdown mode, setting it
to "Off" deactiivates it (the default). The special mode "avahi" turns
auto shutdown off while avahi-daemon is running and on when
avahi-daemon stops. This allows running cups-browsed on-demand when
avahi-daemon is run on-demand.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        AutoShutdown Off
        AutoShutdown On
        AutoShutdown avahi

.fam T
.fi
The AutoShutdownTimeout directive specifies after how many seconds
without local raw queues set up pointing to any discovered remote
printers cups-browsed should actually shut down in auto shutdown
mode. Default is 30 seconds, 0 means immediate shutdown.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        AutoShutdownTimeout 20
