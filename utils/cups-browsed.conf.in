# Which protocols will we use to broadcast shared local printers to the network?
# Can use DNSSD and/or CUPS, or 'none' for neither.
# Only CUPS is actually supported, as DNSSD is done by CUPS itself (we ignore
# DNSSD in this directive).

# BrowseLocalProtocols none


# Settings of this directive apply to both BrowseRemoteProtocols and
# BrowseLocalProtocols.
# Can use DNSSD and/or CUPS and/or LDAP, or 'none' for neither.

# BrowseProtocols none


# Only browse remote printers (via DNS-SD or CUPS browsing) from
# selected servers using the "BrowseAllow", "BrowseDeny", and
# "BrowseOrder" directives

# This serves for restricting the choice of printers in print dialogs
# to trusted servers or to reduce the number of listed printers in the
# print dialogs to a more user-friendly amount in large networks with
# very many shared printers.

# This only filters the selection of remote printers for which
# cups-browsed creates local queues. If the print dialog uses other
# mechanisms to list remote printers as for example direct DNS-SD
# access, cups-browsed has no influence. cups-browsed also does not
# prevent the user from manually accessing non-listed printers.

# "BrowseAllow": Accept printers from these hosts or networks. If
# there are only "BrowseAllow" lines and no "BrowseOrder" and/or
# "BrowseDeny" lines, only servers matching at last one "BrowseAllow"
# line are accepted.

# "BrowseDeny": Deny printers from these hosts or networks. If there
# are only "BrowseDeny" lines and no "BrowseOrder" and/or
# "BrowseAllow" lines, all servers NOT matching any of the
# "BrowseDeny" lines are accepted.

# "BrowseOrder": Determine the order in which "BrowseAllow" and
# "BrowseDeny" lines are applied. With "BrowseOrder Deny,Allow" in the
# beginning all servers are accepted, then the "BrowseDeny" lines are
# applied to exclude unwished servers or networks and after that the
# "BrowseAllow" lines to re-include servers or networks. With
# "BrowseOrder Allow,Deny" we start with denying all servers, then
# applying the "BrowseAllow" lines and afterwards the "BrowseDeny"
# lines.

# Default for "BrowseOrder" is "Deny.Allow" if there are both
# "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" lines.

# If there are no "Browse..." lines at all, all servers are accepted.

# BrowseAllow All
# BrowseAllow cups.example.com
# BrowseAllow 192.168.1.12
# BrowseAllow 192.168.1.0/24
# BrowseAllow 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

# Filtering of remote printers by other properties than IP addresses
# of their servers

# Often the desired selection of printers cannot be reached by only
# taking into account the IP addresses of the servers. For these cases
# there is the BrowseFilter directive to filter by most of the known
# properties of the printer.

# By default there is no BrowseFilter line meaning that no filtering
# is applied.

# To do filtering one can supply one or more BrowseFilter directives
# like this:

# BrowseFilter [NOT] [EXACT] <FIELD> [<VALUE>]

# The BrowseFilter directive always starts with the word
# "BrowseFilter" and it must at least contain the name of the data
# field (<FIELD>) of the printer's properties to which it should
# apply.

# Avaialble field names are:

#   name:    Name of the local print queue to be created
#   host:    Host name of the remote print server
#   port:    Port through which the printer is accessed on the server
#   service: DNS/SD service name of the remote printer
#   domain:  Domain of the remote print server

# Also all field names in the TXT records of DNS-SD-advertised printers
# are valid, like "color", "duplex", "pdl", ... If the field name of
# the filter rule does not exist for the printer, the rule is skipped.

# The optional <VALUE> field is either the exact value (when the
# option EXACT is supplied) or a regular expression (Run "man 7 regex"
# in a terminal window) to be matched with the data field.

# If no <VALUE> filed is supplied, rules with field names of the TXT
# record are considered for boolean matching (true/false) of boolean
# field (like duplex, which can have the values "T" for true and "F"
# for false).

# If the option NOT is supplied, the filter rule is fulfilled if the
# regular expression or the exact value DOES NOT match the content of
# the data field. In a boolean rule (without <VALUE>) the rule matches
# false.

# Regular expressions are always considered case-insensitive and
# extended POSIX regular expressions. Field names and options (NOT,
# EXACT) are all evaluated case-insensitive. If there is an error in a
# regular expression, the BrowseFilter line gets ignored.

# Especially to note is that supplying any simple string consisting of
# only letters, numbers, spaces, and some basic special characters as
# a regular expression matches if it is contained somewhere in the
# data field.

# If there is more than one BrowseFilter directive, ALL the directives
# need to be fulfilled for the remote printer to be accepted. If one
# is not fulfilled, the printer will get ignored.

# Examples:

# Rules for standard data items which are supplied with any remote
# printer advertised via DNS-SD:

# Print queue name must contain "hum_res_", this matches
# "hum_res_mono" or "hum_res_color" but also "old_hum_res_mono":

# BrowseFilter name hum_res_

# This matches if the remote host name contains "printserver", like
# "printserver.local", "printserver2.example.com", "newprintserver":

# BrowseFilter host printserver

# This matches all ports with 631 int its number, for example 631,
# 8631, 10631,...:

# BrowseFilter port 631

# This rule matches if the DNS-SD service name contains "@ printserver":

# Browsefilter service @ printserver

# Matches all domains with "local" in their names, not only "local" but
# also things like "printlocally.com":

# BrowseFilter domain local

# Examples for rules applying to items of the TXT record:

# This rule selects PostScript printers, as the "PDL" field in the TXT
# record contains "postscript" then. This includes also remote CUPS
# queues which accept PostScript, independent of whether the physical
# printer behind the CUPS queue accepts PostScript or not.

# BrowseFilter pdl postscript

# Color printers usually contain a "Color" entry set to "T" (for true)
# in the TXT record. This rule selects them:

# BrowseFilter color

# This is a similar rule to select only duplex (automatic double-sided
# printing) printers:

# BrowseFilter duplex

# Rules with the NOT option:

# This rule EXCLUDES printers from all hosts containing "financial" in
# their names, nice to get rid of the 100s of printers of the
# financial department:

# BrowseFilter NOT host financial

# Get only monochrome printers ("Color" set to "F", meaning false, in
# the TXT record):

# BrowseFilter NOT color

# Rules with more advanced use of regular expressions:

# Only queue names which BEGIN WITH "hum_res_" are accepted now, so we
# still get "hum_res_mono" or "hum_res_color" but not
# "old_hum_res_mono" any more:

# BrowseFilter name ^hum_res_

# Server names is accepted if it contains "print_server" OR
# "graphics_dep_server":

# BrowseFilter host print_server|graphics_dep_server

# "printserver1", "printserver2", and "printserver3", nothing else:

# BrowseFilter host ^printserver[1-3]$

# Printers understanding at least one of PostScript, PCL, or PDF:

# BrowseFilter pdl postscript|pcl|pdf

# Examples for the EXACT option:

# Only printers from "printserver.local" are accepted:

# BrowseFilter EXACT host printserver.local

# Printers from all servers except "prinserver2.local" are accepted:

# BrowseFilter NOT EXACT host prinserver2.local


# Use BrowsePoll to poll a particular CUPS server

# BrowsePoll cups.example.com
# BrowsePoll cups.example.com:631
# BrowsePoll cups.example.com:631/version=1.1


# LDAP browsing configuration
# The default value for all options is an empty string. Example configuration:

# BrowseLDAPBindDN cn=cups-browsed,dc=domain,dc=tld
# BrowseLDAPCACertFile /path/to/server/certificate.pem
# BrowseLDAPDN ou=printers,dc=domain,dc=tld
# BrowseLDAPFilter (printerLocation=/Office 1/*)
# BrowseLDAPPassword s3cret
# BrowseLDAPServer ldaps://ldap.domain.tld


# Use DomainSocket to access the local CUPS daemon via another than the
# default domain socket

# DomainSocket @CUPS_DEFAULT_DOMAINSOCKET@


# Set IPBasedDeviceURIs to "Yes" if cups-browsed should create its
# local queues with device URIs with the IP addresses instead of the
# host names of the remote servers. This mode is there for any
# problems with host name resolution in the network, especially also
# if avahi-daemon is only run for printer discovery and already
# stopped while still printing. By default this mode is turned off,
# meaning that we use URIs with host names.

# If you prefer IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses in the URIs, you can set
# IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv4" to only get IPv4 IP addresses or
# IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv6" to only get IPv6 IP addresses.

# IPBasedDeviceURIs No
# IPBasedDeviceURIs Yes
# IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv4
# IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv6


# Set CreateRemoteRawPrinterQueues to "Yes" to let cups-browsed also
# create local queues pointing to remote raw CUPS queues. Normally,
# only queues pointing to remote queues with PPD/driver are created
# as we do not use drivers on the client side, but in some cases
# accessing a remote raw queue can make sense, for example if the
# queue forwards the jobs by a special backend like Tea4CUPS.

# CreateRemoteRawPrinterQueues Yes


# Set CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "Yes" to let cups-browsed discover IPP
# network printers (native printers, not CUPS queues) with known page
# description languages (PWG Raster, PDF, PostScript, PCL XL, PCL
# 5c/e) in the local network and auto-create PPD-less print queues for
# them (using a System V interface script to control the filter
# chain). Clients have to IPP-poll the capabilities of the printer and
# send option settings as standard IPP attributes. We do not poll the
# capabilities by ourselves to not wake up the printer from
# power-saving mode when creating the queues. Jobs have to be sent in
# PDF format. Other formats are not accepted. This functionality is
# primarily for mobile devices running CUPS to not need a printer
# setup tool nor a collection of printer drivers and PPDs.

# CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes


# If cups-browsed is automatically creating print queues for native
# IPP network printers ("CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes"), the type of
# queue to be created can be selected by the "IPPPrinterQueueType"
# directive.  The "PPD" setting makes always queues with PPD file
# being created and no queue if the printer does not supply sufficient
# information for creating a PPD. With "NoPPD" the queue is always
# created with a System V interface script as filter, also when
# creatig a PPD would be possible.  "Auto" (the default) lets a PPD
# being created if the printer supplies sufficient information and a
# System V interface script otherwise.

# IPPPrinterQueueType Auto
# IPPPrinterQueueType PPD
# IPPPrinterQueueType NoPPD


# The LoadBalancing directive switches between two methods of handling
# load balancing between equally-named remote queues which are
# represented by one local print queue making up a cluster of them
# (implicit class).

# The two methods are:

# Queuing of jobs on the client (LoadBalancing QueueOnClient):

# Here we queue up the jobs on the client and regularly check the
# clustered remote print queues. If we find an idle queue, we pass
# on a job to it.

# This is also the method which CUPS uses for classes. Advantage is a
# more even distribution of the job workload on the servers
# (especially if the printing speed of the servers is very different),
# and if a server fails, there are not several jobs stuck or
# lost. Disadvantage is that if one takes the client (laptop, mobile
# phone, ...) out of the local network, printing stops with the jobs
# waiting in the local queue.

# Queuing of jobs on the servers (LoadBalancing QueueOnServers):

# Here we check the number of jobs on each of the clustered remote
# printers and send an incoming job immediately to the remote printer
# with the lowest amount of jobs in its queue. This way no jobs queue
# up locally, all jobs which are waiting are waiting on one of the
# remote servers.

# Not having jobs waiting locally has the advantage that we can take
# the local machine from the network and all jobs get printed.
# Disadvantage is that if a server with a full queue of jobs goes
# away, the jobs go away, too.

# Default is queuing the jobs on the client as this is what CUPS does
# with classes.

# LoadBalancing QueueOnClient
# LoadBalancing QueueOnServers


# With the DefaultOptions directive one or more option settings can be
# defined to be applied to every print queue newly created by
# cups-browsed. Each option is supplied as one supplies options with
# the "-o" command line argument to the "lpadmin" command (Run "man
# lpadmin" for more details). More than one option can be supplied
# separating the options by spaces. By default no option settings are
# pre-defined.

# Note that print queues which cups-browsed already created before
# remember their previous settings and so these settings do not get
# applied.

# DefaultOptions Option1=Value1 Option2=Value2 Option3 noOption4


# The AutoShutdown directive specifies whether cups-browsed should
# automatically terminate when it has no local raw queues set up
# pointing to any discovered remote printers or no jobs on such queues
# depending on AutoShutdownOn setting (auto shutdown mode). Setting it
# to "On" activates the auto-shutdown mode, setting it to "Off"
# deactiivates it (the default). The special mode "avahi" turns auto
# shutdown off while avahi-daemon is running and on when avahi-daemon
# stops. This allows running cups-browsed on-demand when avahi-daemon
# is run on-demand.

# AutoShutdown Off
# AutoShutdown On
# AutoShutdown avahi


# The AutoShutdownOn directive determines what event cups-browsed
# considers as inactivity in auto shutdown mode. "NoQueues" (the
# default) means that auto shutdown is initiated when there are no
# queues for discovered remote printers generated by cups-browsed any
# more. "NoJobs" means that all queues generated by cups-browsed are
# without jobs.

# AutoShutdownOn NoQueues
# AutoShutdownOn NoJobs


# The AutoShutdownTimeout directive specifies after how many seconds
# without local raw queues set up pointing to any discovered remote
# printers or jobs on these queues cups-browsed should actually shut
# down in auto shutdown mode. Default is 30 seconds, 0 means immediate
# shutdown.

# AutoShutdownTimeout 30
