libfontembed - font embedding and subsetting library
----------------------------------------------------

This library implements all the stuff required to
embed and subset TrueType fonts, as for example 
required in PDF files. It is completely self-contained,
although a FreeType binding might come sometime in the future.

Currently only glyf-flavored TrueType is supported,
but OTF, i.e. CFF-flavored TrueType/OpenType is on the way.
Also reencoding and conversion of Type1 to CFF is planned.
PostScript embedding is another goal of the project.

Usage
